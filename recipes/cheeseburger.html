        <h2>Classic, Juicy Cheese Burger</h2>

        <p>Our Classic, Juicy Cheese Burger is all about comfort and flavor. A thick beef patty is grilled until it is tender and full of flavor, then topped with a generous slice of cheese that melts perfectly over the meat. Every bite is hearty and satisfying, just the way a good burger should be.</p>
        <p>We serve it on a soft toasted bun with crisp lettuce, fresh tomato, sweet red onions, and a few pickles for that extra crunch. It is simple, wholesome, and made to remind you of the kind of burger you would enjoy at a family bbq or around the kitchen table.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g ground beef, about 80/20 lean to fat</li>
            <li>1 burger bun, split and lightly toasted</li>
            <li>1 slice cheddar cheese, 20-25 g</li>
            <li>Soft toasted burger bun</li>
            <li>1 crisp lettuce leaf</li>
            <li>1-2 slices tomato</li>
            <li>3-4 rings red onion</li>
            <li>3-4 pickle slices</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (15 ml) mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tsp (5 ml) butter or neutral oil for toasting the bun</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Prep the toppings. Slice the tomato, red onion, and pickles. Have your cheese slice ready.</li>
                <li>Shape the patty. Gently form the 200 g beef into a disc about 10 cm wide and roughly 2 cm thick. Make a small dimple in the centre with your thumb to help it cook flat. Do not overwork the meat.</li>
                <li>Toast the bun. Heat a pan on medium. Add the butter or oil and toast the cut sides of the bun until golden, 30-60 seconds. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Season just before cooking. Increase the pan to medium-high. Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the patty.</li>
                <li>Cook the first side. Add a few drops of oil if the pan is dry. Place the patty in the pan and cook without pressing, about 4-5 minutes, until well browned.</li>
                <li>Flip and add cheese. Turn the patty and cook 3-4 minutes more. In the last minute, place the cheese on top. Add a teaspoon of water to the pan and cover to help the cheese melt.</li>
                <li>Check doneness. For safety, aim for an internal temperature of about 70 Â°C for ground beef. If you do not have a thermometer, look for clear juices and a firm but still juicy feel.</li>
                <li>Rest. Move the patty to a plate and rest 2 minutes so the juices settle.</li>
                <li>Build the burger. Spread the sauce on the bottom bun, add lettuce, the cheesy patty, tomato, red onion, pickles, then the top bun. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
